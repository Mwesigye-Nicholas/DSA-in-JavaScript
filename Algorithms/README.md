## üìù Introduction  
Algorithms are a set of instructions to solve specific problems. This repository covers various algorithms that are commonly used in coding interviews and competitive programming.  

- Algorithms improve efficiency üìà  
- They form the basis for data manipulation and computation üî¢  

## üìÇ Sorting Algorithms  
Sorting algorithms rearrange elements in a list or array into a specified order. Here‚Äôs a list of common sorting algorithms:  

1. **Bubble Sort**:   
   - Repeatedly steps through the list.  
   - Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  

2. **Selection Sort**:   
   - Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted one.  
   - Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part.  

3. **Insertion Sort**:   
   - Builds the sorted array one item at a time.  
   - Efficient for small data sets.  

4. **Merge Sort**:   
   - Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.  
   - Efficient with many elements.  

5. **Quick Sort**:   
   - Picks a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around it.  
   - Recursive approach yields high performance on average.  

6. **Heap Sort**:   
   - Utilizes a binary heap data structure.  
   - Efficient and performs well for large data sets.  

7. **Shell Sort**:   
   - Generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items far apart.  
   - Reduces the amount of shifting.  

8. **Radix Sort**:   
   - Sorts numbers by processing individual digits.  
   - Works efficiently with fixed-length data.  

## üîç Search Algorithms  
Search algorithms help find specific items within a data structure. Common search algorithms include:  

1. **Linear Search**:   
   - Simple method that examines each element in sequence.  
   - Useful for unsorted datasets.  

2. **Binary Search**:   
   - Efficiently finds an item in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  

## üåê Graph Algorithms  
Graph algorithms are used to solve problems involving graph data structures. Key algorithms include:  

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:   
   - Explores as far down a branch before backtracking.  
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:   
   - Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.  
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:   
   - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.  
4. **A* Search**:   
   - An extension of Dijkstra's that uses heuristics to optimize path finding.  
5. **Kruskal's Algorithm**:   
   - Finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.  
6. **Prim's Algorithm**:   
   - Another algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.  

## üìà Dynamic Programming  
Dynamic programming algorithms solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Examples include:  

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**:   
   - Efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers using memoization.  
2. **Knapsack Problem**:   
   - Solves optimization problems by considering items and their weights.  
3. **Longest Common Subsequence**:   
   - Finds the longest subsequence present in two sequences.  
4. **Coin Change Problem**:   
   - Determines the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount.  

## üîÑ Other Algorithms  
In addition to the categories above, here are some additional common algorithms:  

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Build up a solution piece by piece, choosing the next piece with the most immediate benefit.  
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Solve problems by testing all possible combinations.  
- **Brute Force Algorithms**: Simple algorithms that try all possible solutions before finding the correct one.  

## üöÄ Best Practices  
To effectively implement algorithms in JavaScript, consider the following best practices:  

- **Write Clear Code**: Use descriptive variable and function names.  
- **Optimize Performance**: Implement efficient algorithms to save time and resources.  
- **Test Your Code**: Always write tests to verify correctness.  

## üîö Conclusion
