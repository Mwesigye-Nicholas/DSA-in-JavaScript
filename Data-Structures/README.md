Data Structures in JavaScript
Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer science. They define how data is organized and stored in a computer to enable efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
Here we go through a detailed overview of the data structure.

Classification of Data Structures
Data structures can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. Linear Data Structures
In linear data structures, elements are arranged sequentially, providing a single level of access.

Static Data Structures: Size is determined at compile time.
Example: Arrays
Dynamic Data Structures: Size can be modified during runtime.
Examples:
Queue: Adheres to the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Stack: Follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Linked List: A series of nodes where each node points to the next.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures
In non-linear data structures, elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner or through connections not necessarily sequential.

Types:
Tree: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
Graph: A collection of vertices connected by edges; can be directed or undirected.
Memory Management in JavaScript
JavaScript performs memory management automatically through a process called garbage collection. Understanding the nuances of memory management is crucial for optimizing performance when using various data structures.

Memory Handling Overview
Arrays and Objects: Dynamic memory allocation allows for variable sizes. Access is typically fast due to index-based (for arrays) or key-based (for objects) methods.

Linked Lists: Memory is dynamically allocated for each node, allowing for flexible size arrangements but requiring sequential access.

Stacks and Queues: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, offering efficient access patterns specific to their structures.

Trees: Nodes are allocated dynamically to form branches, promoting efficient searching when balanced correctly.

Graphs: Memory can be represented through adjacency lists or matrices, depending on the density of connections.

Garbage Collection Techniques
JavaScript engines, like V8, use various methods to reclaim unused memory:

Mark-and-Sweep: This involves identifying memory that is no longer accessible and clearing it.
Reference Counting: Tracks the number of references to an object; once an object's reference count drops to zero, it can be collected.
Best Practices for Memory Management
To maintain optimal memory usage in your JavaScript applications, consider the following:

Minimize Global Variables: Limit your use of global variables, as they remain in memory throughout the application lifespan.
Nullify Unused References: Explicitly set variables to null when they are no longer needed to aid garbage collection.
Use Weak References: Implement WeakMap or WeakSet for objects that should not prevent their garbage collection when no longer needed.
